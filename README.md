# Demo bookshop-mobile : CAP sample extended with mobile app

## About this project

This project is based on the CAP sample application called bookshop, which you can generate as part of the "cds init" command.
The application was deployed to BTP, so that we can extend it with a mobile application based on SAP Mobile Development Kit (MDK).
